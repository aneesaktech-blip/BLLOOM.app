  <!-- ABOUT BLLOOM -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>What is BLLOOM?</h2>
    <p>
      BLLOOM is a forward-thinking fashion and design brand built on the belief
      that artificial intelligence can amplify creativity rather than replace it.
      We use AI-driven systems to generate concepts, patterns, and design directions,
      blending technology with human intuition to create modern, expressive products.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every BLLOOM piece starts as an idea — shaped by algorithms, refined by vision,
      and brought to life through thoughtful design. This is fashion in the age of AI.

  <!-- AI REVOLUTION -->
  <section class="about-section alt">
    <h2>The AI Revolution</h2>
    <p>
      At BLLOOM, AI is not just a tool- it is a collaborator.
      From generating unique silhouettes to predicting trends and color palettes,
      artificial intelligence helps us move faster, think broader, and design smarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The future of creativity lies at the intersection of technology and imagination,
      and BLLOOM exists exactly at that point.

        <h2>Aneesa Karim</h2>
        <span>Founder & Creative Director</span>

        <p>
          BLLOOM was founded in Class 9 by Aneesa Karim, a young creator driven by
          curiosity, technology, and design. What began as an experimental idea soon
          evolved into a brand that explores how AI can reshape creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now in 11th grade, Aneesa continues to build BLLOOM while learning,
          experimenting, and pushing boundaries, proving that innovation has no age.
